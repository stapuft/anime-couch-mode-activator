 have managed to squash a few more bugs and figured i would share the update.


this is a userscript that allows you to just sit back, and enjoy, it will automatically go fullscreen, and give focus to the video in order to allow keyboard shortcuts to work.


on top of that, it also adds 2 new FF buttons and 2 new RW buttons one each for 30 seconds, and for 90 seconds, in order to skip the intro songs you dont like or repeat the ones you do, and enable a more..."netflix like" experience, for the "Pirate conissour".


if you have firefox to enable the auto fullscreen feature you have to go to about:config and change the value of "full-screen-api.allow-trusted-requests-only" from "true" to "false" and then install these like any other userscripts (you will need both "pard-un" and "pard-deux" to get the full experiance.


    RW large amount amount of time (default 91 seconds)-h

    RW medium amount amount of time (default 30 seconds)-j

    FF medium amount amount of time (default 30 seconds)-k

    FF large amount amount of time (default 89 seconds)-L


thanks to those who contributed time into this and helping me simplify it. if anyone needs help or has suggestions just let me know hope you enjoy this as much as i I will


if you feel brave you can always add
// @include      http://*/*
// @include      https://*/*
in with the other @include lines, but ***/be warned/***, this may unintentionally break websites this script is not designed for.
